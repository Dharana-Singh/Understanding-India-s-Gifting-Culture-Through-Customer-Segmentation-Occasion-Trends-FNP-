Outcomes: The dashboard provides insights into customer value tiers, occasion-based revenue trends, monthly order performance, and the impact of key customer segments on revenue generation.

Key Insights:
1. Top 2 Customer Segments Drive Most Revenue: “Champions" and "Loyal Customers" contribute the highest share of revenue, indicating a strong core group of repeat customers.
2. Seasonal Occasions Create Revenue Spikes: Events like Raksha Bandhan and Holi see a significant surge in both revenue and unique customers, suggesting successful seasonal campaigns.
3. Revenue Peaks in Q1 and Q3: Monthly and quarterly charts show clear revenue surges in March and August, guiding inventory and campaign strategies.

Actionable Recommendations:
1. Double Down on Loyal Segments: Create loyalty programs, exclusive previews, or discounts for "Champions" and "Loyal Customers" to sustain and increase their lifetime value.
2. Leverage Occasion-Based Marketing: Focus campaigns around high-performing events (Raksha Bandhan, Holi). Introduce targeted bundles or limited-time offers.
3. Nurture “Potential Loyalists” and “At Risk” Segments: Use retargeting emails, reactivation coupons, or personalised offers to move these groups into higher-value segments.
